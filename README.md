# HPOptimization
All papers and code associated with experimentation of hyperparameter optimization frameworks.

## COMING SOON
My research paper and code are in the process of being cleared by the legal team at Corning Incorporated from my time there on assignment through Magnit. Immediately following the release of my document, I will attach it to this repository and update the readme accordingly. Additionally, I will provide a link to my code in the offical Corning Incorporated github once it is published there. Unfortunately, until then, I can elaborate very little on what the paper contains.
